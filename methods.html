            <p>My full CV can be found here: <a href="papers/Chris_Halsch_CV.pdf" target="_blank"> [CV] </a> </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am a postdoctoral associate in <a href="https://elizagrames.github.io/" target="_blank"> Eliza Grames’ lab</a> at Binghamton University. My work focuses on the multifaceted nature of the Anthropocene and its impact on butterfly populations. In other words, I chase butterflies in the mountains.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I received my Ph.D. in 2023 from the University of Nevada Reno, where I was advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/greatbasinbuglab/" target="_blank"> Matthew Forister</a>. My dissertation work focused on understanding butterfly population trends in California. As part of this work, I had the great honor of continuing data collection for <a href="https://butterfly.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"> Art Shapiro’s long-term time series</a>. Before UNR, I worked in science education. This took me to Crystal Cove State Park in Southern California and the Carrizo Plain National Monument in the California Central Valley. At Crystal Cove, I worked for <a href="https://crystalcove.org/" target="_blank"> Crystal Cove Conservancy</a>, a non-profit organization, where I developed education programs that engaged K-12 students in community science research. These programs engaged students in active research in restoration ecology and butterfly monitoring.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I am not in the mountains looking for butterflies, I am in the mountains to be in the mountains! Summiting a peak, cresting a pass, or cruising through a giant valley are captivating experiences, and I am always trying to find reasons to go back. I would be lying if I told you that is not a major reason why I conduct my research in the locations I do. I am also a bit of a fantasy nerd, D&D obsessive, and coffee enthusiast.</p>
