          <h3>Literature searach</h3>
            <p>To construct the network of proposed drivers of insect decline from the non-primary literature, we performed the following literature search on January 13, 2024, on ISI Web of Science, searching the Core Collection and SciELO databases:</p>
            <p1>TS=(("insect" OR "insects" OR "insecta" OR "Megaloptera" OR "Alderflies" OR"Dobsonfl*" OR "Fishfl*" OR "Zoraptera" OR "Angel Insect*" OR "Neuroptera" OR "Antlion*" OR "Owlfl*" OR "Lacewing*" OR "Mantidfl*" OR "Hymenoptera" OR "Ants" OR "ant" OR "Bee" OR "bees" OR "Wasp" OR "Sawfl*" OR "Psocodea" OR "Barklice" OR "Booklice" OR "Parasitic Lice" OR "Coleoptera" OR "Beetle*" OR "Microcoryphia" OR "Bristletail*" OR "Lepidoptera" OR "Butterfl*" OR "Moths" OR "moth" OR "Trichoptera" OR "Caddisfl*" OR "Blattodea" OR "Cockroach*" OR "Termite*" OR "Odonat*" OR "Dragonfl*" OR "Damselfl*" OR"Dermaptera" OR "Earwig*" OR "Siphonaptera" OR "Flea*" OR "Diptera" OR "Flies" OR "fly" OR "Orthoptera" OR "Grasshopper*" OR "Cricket*" OR "Katydid*" OR "Notoptera" OR "Ice Crawler*" OR "Rock Crawler*" OR "Mantodea" OR "Mantid*" OR "Ephemeroptera" OR "Mayfl*" OR "Protorthoptera" OR "Mecoptera" OR "Scorpionfl*" OR "Hangingfl*" OR "Zygentoma" OR "Silverfish" OR "Raphidioptera" OR "Snakefl*" OR "Phasmid*" OR "Plecoptera" OR "Stonefl*" OR "Thysanoptera" OR "Thrip*" OR "Hemiptera*" OR "True Bug*" OR "Cicada*" OR "Hopper*" OR "Aphid*" OR "Strepsiptera" OR "Embiidina" OR "Webspinner*" OR hoverfl* OR bumblebee* OR pollinator*) NEAR/10 ((declin* OR extinction OR "insect apocalypse" OR "insectageddon" OR "biodiversity loss" OR "biodiversity crisis" OR "population decline" OR "pollinator decline")))</p1>
            <p>This initial search identified 3,387 research articles that have been published since 2017. Every study was screened and only papers that were reviews, meta-analyses, or perspectives that specifically proposed causes of declines of insects were kept, leaving 175 published articles. Each of the final set of papers was read in detail and all hypothesized causal pathways between a driver and an outcome for insects were extracted, regardless of where they occurred in the paper (introduction, discussion, etc.). Hypotheses that only occurred in the introductory paragraphs and were never elaborated on or repeated anywhere else in the paper were given an additional tag to indicate that it was only mentioned in passing (e.g. “global warming, agricultural intensification, habitat homogenization as well as diseases and pathogens strongly affect wild bee populations”) and these pathways were removed from the final network. For each study, we recorded the article title, authors, the study type (review, meta-analysis, etc.), and year of publication. Each article had the potential to contribute many pathways to the network, with the most from a single article being 83. We tagged each pathway with the taxa, species traits, habitat, and region it applied to (if specified).</p>
          <h3>Network creation</h3>  
          <p>Each pathway was turned into an edge with the linked ideas forming the nodes (drivers, mediators, outcomes). Nodes were categorized at different levels of resolution as described in the main text. Each edge was tagged with taxa it referred to, with varying specificity. For instance, the pathway “light pollution -> moth abundance” would be associated with both “Lepidoptera” and “insects” for taxa. Alternatively, the pathway “insecticides -> honeybee health” would be tagged as:  honeybees, bees, Hymenoptera, and insects. Pathways were also tagged based on whether they were extracted from a review or a quantitative synthesis (i.e., a meta-analysis). Finally, a variable was created for each edge to indicate what the ultimate source and outcome was when it was proposed. For example, the pathway “nitrification -> floral resources -> larval mortality” would be broken into the two pathways: “nitrification -> floral resources” and “floral resources -> larval mortality” and each of these would have an ultimate predictor of nitrification and an ultimate outcome of larval mortality. The network was built using the igraph package and is presented in an interactive form using the shinyR package in R, allowing users to filter the network based on any of the parameters described above. When a parameter is selected, the full dataset used to generate the initial network is reduced to only a subset and a new network is then projected. A network is then generated from the resulting data frame using the graph_from_data_frame function in the igraph R package. The Shiny app also generates summary statistics for the current network as well as the exact bibliography used to generate the network.</p>
